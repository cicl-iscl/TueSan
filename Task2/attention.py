"""
Implements MLP (Bahdanau-style) attention.

Given the encoder hidden state and the character embeddings of the input token,
calculate a so-called attention score for each input character.
Then, attention scores are normalised across all input characters.
Finally, we represent the input encoding at the current timestep as a
weighted sum of character embeddings (weights = attention scores)

The idea is as follows:
Whenever we predict the next character, we dynamically calculate which
part of the input is currently most important. Thereby, we get a different
encoding of the input for each predicted character instead of only a fixed
token embedding. This makes the model more flexible.

The term attention comes from the idea that the model focuses ('attends') on
the currently most relevant part of the input.

For predicting stems, this could be helpful, if the stem is (partially)
present in the input, because then the decoder can simply pick out the
currently matching input characters.

Another advantage of attention is in terms of information flow:
Using attention introduces a shortcut connection how input information
(here from the convolutional ngram encoders) influences the decoder output.
This may speed up optimisation, because all intermediate representations are
bypassed and the prediction errors during training are backpropagated much
more directly to the input encodings.

MLP attention employs a MLP to calculate the attention score
from the character embeddings and the decoder hidden state.
There are also other flavours of attention, for example bilinear attention
and self-attention.

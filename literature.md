## Word Segmentation

- [S. Krishnan and A. Kulkarni, 2019] [Sanskrit Segmentation Revisited](https://aclanthology.org/2019.icon-1.12.pdf)
  - proposes modifications for the Heritage Segmenter (FST that produces all possible segmentations): 
  End goal is segmentation, ignore phases except for those that are related to compounds, calculates a confidence value C for each segmentation solution as the POP (product-of-products) of the word and transition probabilities. 
  - Section 2 gives a brief review of exsisting approaches to the segmentation problem, it serves as an entrypoint to other papers
    - [Huet, 2003] Heritage Segmenter - FST, one for external (sentence) sandhi and one for internal (word) sandhi
    - [Mittal, 2010] Optimality Theory to validate possible segmentations produced by rule-based FST.

    - [Krishna et al., 2016] Path Constrained Random Walk framework for selecting nodes from the segmentation graph with possible solutions, combining morphological features and word co-occurence features from a manually tagged corpus (Hellwig, 2009).
    - [Aralikatte et al., 2018] Double Decoder RNN with attention as seq2(seq)^2: one decoder learns the split locations (where), the other learns the splits themselves (how).
    - [Hellwig and Nehrdich, 2018] Character-level Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks, disregard the difference between splitting joint words and compounds, does not require feature engineering or external linguistic resources, claims to work well with just the parallel versions of raw and segmented text.
    - [Krishna et al., 2018] a structured prediction framework using EBM (energy based model), solves word segmentation AND morphological tagging tasks, graph-based parsing techniques.

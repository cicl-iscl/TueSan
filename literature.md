## Word Segmentation

- [S. Krishnan and A. Kulkarni, 2019] [Sanskrit Segmentation Revisited](https://aclanthology.org/2019.icon-1.12.pdf)
  - proposes modifications for the Heritage Segmenter (FST that produces all possible segmentations): 
  End goal is segmentation, ignore phases except for those that are related to compounds, calculates a confidence value C for each segmentation solution as the POP (product-of-products) of the word and transition probabilities. 
  - Section 2 gives a brief review of exsisting approaches to the segmentation problem, it serves as an entrypoint to other papers
    - [Huet, 2003] Heritage Segmenter - FST, one for external (sentence) sandhi and one for internal (word) sandhi
    - [Mittal, 2010] Optimality Theory to validate possible segmentations produced by rule-based FST.
    - [Kumar et al., 2010] compound segmentation using probabilistic method
    - [Natarajan and Charniak, 2011] Bayesian segmentation algorithm
    - [Krishna et al., 2016] Path Constrained Random Walk framework for selecting nodes from the segmentation graph with possible solutions, combining morphological features and word co-occurence features from a manually tagged corpus (Hellwig, 2009).
    - [Aralikatte et al., 2018] Double Decoder RNN with attention as seq2(seq)^2: one decoder learns the split locations (where), the other learns the splits themselves (how).
    - [Hellwig and Nehrdich, 2018] Character-level Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks, disregard the difference between splitting joint words and compounds, does not require feature engineering or external linguistic resources, claims to work well with just the parallel versions of raw and segmented text.
    - [Krishna et al., 2018] a structured prediction framework using EBM (energy based model), solves word segmentation AND morphological tagging tasks, graph-based parsing techniques.

- [Aralikatte et al., 2018] [Sanskrit Sandhi Splitting using seq2(seq)^2](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1530/)
  - compound splitting (internal sandhi)
  - Datasets: [UoH corpus](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/Corpus/) + [SandhiKosh corpus](https://github.com/sanskrit-sandhi/SandhiKosh) (Shubham Bhardwaj, 2018), pruned against Monier-Williams Dictionary
  - Double-Decoder RNN model with attention (*location decoder* predicts split locations, *character decoder* generates split words, trained separately)
- [Hellwig and Nehrdich, 2018] [Sanskrit Word Segmentation Using Character-level Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1295/)
  - [new dataset](https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/papers/2018emnlp) published, more than 560,000 sentences with manually validated splits from the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS)
  - defined the SWS task (Sanskrit word splitting), does not differentiate between compound and inter-word splits
  - identifies the problem of compositional vs. non-compositional readings of compounds, which is also debatable among human annotators
  - future direction: a joint model for learning splits as well as lexical and morphological annotations---"We hypothesize that CTC ([Graves, 2012](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf)) trained as a co-task or segmental NNs ([Lu et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00223)) with a modified objective (including split probabilities) may be suitable for this task."
